# Qiskit Aqua Finance Tutorials, Samples and Input Files

Qiskit Finance is a set of tools, algorithms and software for use with quantum computers to 
carry out research and investigate how to take advantage of quantum computing power to solve problems 
in the financial domain. 

Qiskit Finance translates finance-specific problems into inputs
for a quantum algorithm residing in Qiskit Aqua, which in turn uses [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for the relevant
quantum computation. 

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples. There are Python code files too.

For more detail see the main [index](../aqua/index.ipynb#optimization)

## Input files

The folder [input_files](input_files) contains example JSON input files that can be loaded 
and run by the Qiskit Aqua [GUI](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#gui) or by the Qiskit Aqua
[command line](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#command-line) tool.
