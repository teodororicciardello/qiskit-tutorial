# Quantum Cryptography
## QRandom --> Generates random numbers.
The random number is directly generated from a Hadamard gate using Qiskit Terra. It is similar to rolling an `n`-faced dice, where `n` is the number of qubits. It is the worst way to generate random numbers using a quantum computer but the sequence developed is truly random. 

For a more detailed example of generating random variates from various distributions using Qiskit aqua, take a look at [this tutorial](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/aqua/generating_random_variates.ipynb).
