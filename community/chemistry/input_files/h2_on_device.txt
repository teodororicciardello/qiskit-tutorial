&name
H2 molecule experiment. This configuration shows what might be used on a near-term real device.
The device (backend) has been set to qasm_simulator so it can be run. On a real device
the Qconfig.py would need to be set with token etc. This experiment will make many evaluations
on the device during its variational approach to finding the minimum eigenvalue of the
Hamiltonian, i.e. the ground state energy.
