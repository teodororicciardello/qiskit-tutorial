# Qiskit Chemistry Tutorials, Samples and Input Files

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples showing how to run chemistry experiments using in
Qiskit Chemistry. There are also Python code files too as well as some hdf5 files containing saved
molecular data that may be used in experiments.

These example programs and notebooks show how to use the dictionary equivalent form of
the [input file](#input-files) that can be used more effectively programmatically when your goal is to
run the content with a range of different values. For example the [energyplot](energyplot.ipynb) notebook
alters the interatomic distance of a molecule, over a range of values, and uses the results to plot graphs.

For more detail see the main [index](../index.ipynb#chemistry)

## Input files

The folder [input_files](input_files) contains a number of example input files that can be loaded
and run by the Qiskit Chemistry [GUI](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-chemistry/blob/master/README.md#gui) or by the
[command line](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-chemistry/blob/master/README.md#command-line) tool.
