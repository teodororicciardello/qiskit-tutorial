# Qiskit Aqua Tutorials 

Qiskit Algorithms for QUantum Applications (Qiskit Aqua) is a library of algorithms for quantum computing
that uses [Qiskit Terra](https://qiskit.org/terra) to build out and run quantum circuits.

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples showing how to run algorithms in Qiskit Aqua.
There are also Python code files too.

For more detail see the main [index](../index.ipynb#aqua)

## Input files

The folder [input_files](../input_files) contains a number of example json input files that can be loaded 
and run by the Qiskit Aqua [GUI](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#gui) or by the Qiskit Aqua
[command line](https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua/README.md#command-line) tool.


## Domains

Aqua provides a library of cross-domain algorithms upon which domain-specific applications and stacks can be
built. Tutorials, sample code and sample input files may be found here for:

* [Qiskit Chemistry](../chemistry)
* [Qiskit Optimization](../optimization)
* [Qiskit Artificial Intelligence](../artificial_intelligence)
* [Qiskit Finance](../finance)

More information may be found the [main index notebook](index.ipynb).
