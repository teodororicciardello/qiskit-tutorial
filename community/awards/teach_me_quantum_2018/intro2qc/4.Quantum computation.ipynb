    "# 4. Quantum computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation is a new way of doing computation which differs from the classical way. Classical computations can be implemented in several ways, the most successful one today is the circuit model of computation. This is how elements in modern computers are designed. In the circuit model, a computation is made by taking a string of bits as inputs, doing certain operations on them and giving a new string of bits as output. In the current paradigm, these operations are logical operations that follow Boole's logic. It was proved that one needs to be able to carry out a limited set of operation (namely \"NOT gate\", and \"AND gate\") in order to implement any operation (addition, multiplication, division, ... ) by a combination of operation from this set. This fundamental set of gates is called an \"elementary set of gates\" and is all that is required to be able to do any computation. Similarly to classical computation, quantum computation can be done using the circuit model of computation. In this case, bits are replaced by qubits and logic gates must be substituted with quantum gates which can operate on qubits while keeping intact their special quantum properties. Quantum circuits must be reversible due to the reversibility inherent in the laws of quantum mechanics. \n",
    "A reversible circuit allows you to run the computation backwards and retrieve the inputs given the outputs. Classical computation can also be implemented using reversible gates but there are disadvantages with regards to the circuit size and complexity. Thus, modern computer are built with \"irreversible\" logic (which means it's impossible to run the computation backwards, see truth table of the \"AND\" gate for example) and this is the reason why the generate heat! In order to have reversible quantum gates, one must implement these gates using, what is called a \"unitary operation\", that is an operation which preserve the sum of the probabilities of seeing each of the measurable values of the qubits. Although, the probability of seeing any single outcome can change, their sum will always add up to one.\n"

    "Another interesting property of qubits, which departs from the classical world, is that they can be entangled. If qubits are entangled with each other, the value taken by each of them is strictly related to the value taken by the other. The correlations between the values of entangled qubits is so strong that it cannot be described by classical probability theory. This is one of the most peculiar features of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "In a way, entangled qubits lose their identity as individual objects, as their properties now depend on the properties of the other qubits with which they are entangled. It's not possible to separate an entangled system in independent parts and it must be treated as a new unit (in quantum mechanical terms, the state of the whole system is not separable, it cannot be factorized as product state of the state of individual systems).\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The state shown in 1. can be manipulated so that it will look like the tensor product of the state of the first qubit and the state of the second qubit. In fact, we can rewrite 1. as: $ \\lvert 0 \\rangle_1 \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\lvert 0 \\rangle_2 + \\lvert 1 \\rangle_2 \\right) $. Thus, we can say that the first qubit is in the state $0$ and the second qubit is in an equal superposition of $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "The same procedure cannot be done on the two-qubit state shown in 2. which cannot be manipulated so that the two-qubit state looks like a tensor product of the state of the first qubit and the state of the second qubit. Therefore, one cannot say anything about the state of a single qubit in state 2. but one has always to talk about the joint state of the two qubits. If one of them has value $0$ the other one will have value $0$ as well, and if one qubit has value $1$, the other qubit will have value $1$ too. This purely quantum correlation between the states of a system is what is called quantum entanglement.   "
