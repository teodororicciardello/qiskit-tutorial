    " * [Python](https://www.python.org/) language\n",
    " * [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook environment\n",
    " * Some linear algebra: inner and outer products, eigenvalues, norms, transpose, adjoints (complex conjugates), tensor product, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "After completing this course, students should be able to:\n",
    " * Understand the basics of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    " * Know how a computing model can be built around Quantum Mechanics\n",
    " * Understand the advantages, disadvantages and implications of Quantum Computing\n",
    " * Understand Quantum Information Science and how it contrasts with classical information theory\n",
    " * Leverage QISKit towards research and development in the _Quantum World_\n",
    " * Understand the empirical differences between Quantum Simulators and real Quantum Devices (such as those available in IBMQ)\n",
    " * Design, interpret and deploy quantum circuits (simulators and real processors)\n",
    " * Know and describe a few of the most common quantum algorithms: Deutsch, Grover, Shor\n",
    " * Be able to quickly understand new quantum algorithms based on the same principles: Simon, ...\n",
    " * Be able to quickly understand new principles of quantum computing: Adiabatic, ...\n",

    "## Customizing Slides\n",
    "#### Reusing Slides\n",
    "The materials in this course can be adapted to specific classes, contexts, schools,... to the desire of the educators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `author`, `date` and `instute` properties of each presentation is defined in the respective `macros.sty` file (this file is an exact copy for each week). If you want to update global settings for all weeks (like the author, update links colors, update code snippets display, ...) you can use the [`sh replicate_macros.sh`](utils/replicate_macros.sh) (linux) | [`replicate_macros.bat`](utils/replicate_macros.bat) (windows) to replicate the changes from a copy of the file for every week's folder (the source file must be in the [utils](utils/) folder, there is already an updated version of [macros.sty](utils/macros.sty) in there).\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraint for using this materials is to replace the `\\author[]{}` command by the following command: `\\author[LASTNAME]{FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,\\\\ \\scriptsize{based on slides by \\textbf{Miguel Sozinho Ramalho}}}` with the update author info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Animating Slides\n",
    "Each `.pdf` file for slides is static, but if you want to include animations you can do so by replacing the `document` class in the first line of the `main.tex` files by `\\documentclass[handout]{beamer}`) and following [these instructions](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/177060/126771).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Notes to Slides\n",
    "This can also be accomplished by appending the following lines before `\\begin{document}`:\n",
    "```tex\n",
    "\\usepackage{pgfpages}\n",
    "\\setbeameroption{show notes}\n",
    "\\setbeameroption{show notes on second screen=right}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compiling LaTeX files\n",
    "To achieve this use any LaTeX compiler of your choice, if you have [pdflatex](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) you can simply do `pdflatex main.tex` on each week's latex folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Presenting Slides with Notes and/or Animations\n",
    "To present the slides with **notes** or with **animations** will only work with an external program, I advise [dannyedel/dspdfviewer](https://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer/releases) which also has dual screen and timer functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aditional notes\n",
    "Each week's slides has a particular theme, that is to help students distinguish between them and strengthen the learning process by fostering association. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Final remarks\n",
    "This was an excelent oportunity to both  teach and learn. I have sought to come up with a methodology of how I wanted my quantum education to have been, hopefully this will help others with similar learning tastes. If not, oh well, shift happens...\n",
