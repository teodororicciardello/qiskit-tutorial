## Teach Me QISKit Award 2018: Top Submissions

This folder contains the top submissions of the Teach Me QISKit Award 2018.
Most of the tutorials were written and tested with [qiskit-terra](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra)
version 0.4.15.


Thanks to the awesome community these tutorials are updated to work with the Qiskit Terra (0.8.1).
- [CHSH Game](chsh_game/CHSH%20game-tutorial.ipynb) by Mirko Amico - get used to the quantum weirdness by playing a quantum game.
- [Cryptography with BB84](cryptography/Cryptography.ipynb) by Costantino Carugno - implementation of the famous BB84 protocol.

The following work with Qiskit Terra (0.6.0).
- [W State](w_state) by Pierre Decoodt - W states and interesting games using them.
- [State Distribution in Qubit Chains](state_distribution_in_qubit_chains/index.ipynb) by Alexander Yu. Vlasov  - state transport in quantum chains.
- [E91 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol](e91_qkd/e91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol.ipynb) by Andrey Kardashin  - a tutorial on quantum key distribution based on the protocol by Ekert in 1991.
- [Elementary Arithmetic Operations](elementary_arithmetic_operations/elementary_arithmetic_operations.ipynb) by Carlos Bravo Prieto - addition and modular exponentiation with quantum circuits which are important for Shor's algorithm.
- [Hadamard Action](hadamard_action) by Connor Fieweger - three approaches to show equivalences of circuits.
- [Quantum Cryptography](quantum_cryptography_qkd/Quantum_Cryptography2.ipynb) by A. J. Rasmusson and Richard Barney  - quantum key distribution with the BB84 protocol.
- [Quantum Error Correction](quantum_error_correction/error_correction.ipynb) by Andrew Selzler, Yin Li, Frederick Ira Moxley III  - qubit errors and how to threat them.
- [Quantum Machine Learning](quantum_machine_learning/QISKIT%20for%20quantum%20machine%20learning.ipynb) by Shan Jin, Xi He, Xiaokai Hou, Li Sun, Dingding Wen, Shaojun Wu and Xiaoting Wang - quantum k-means, linear system of equation, and SVM.

The following work with Qiskit Terra (0.4.15) from time of submission.
- [Exact Ising Model Simulation](exact_ising_model_simulation/Ising_time_evolution.ipynb) by Alba Cervera-Lierta - how to simulate time evolution at zero time. *The winner* of the Teach Me QISKit Award 2018.
