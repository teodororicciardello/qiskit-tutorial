# Hello World

When learning a new language, or using a new programming tool, our first instinct is often just to make something happen. Then we can move on to trying more complex things with confidence.

For example, when lerning Python, your first line of code was probably something like

    print('Hello World')
This would have done nothing but make `Hello World` appear on screen, but it was proof that your Python installation was working and that you could do things with it.

So what should we do with Qiskit? What is the simplest way to show that we can indeed create quantum programs and run them on real quantum hardware?

This folder contains answers to this question. By looking through the notebooks here, you can learn how to implement the shortest and simplest projects for quantum computers. Then once you've learned this, your first quantum project could be to come up with something even better. We welcome all suggestions for a quantum 'Hello World'.

## Contents

For the purpose of testing your installation, the most simplest programs here are:
* [Hello Zero](hello_zero.ipynb)
* [Quantum World](quantum_world.ipynb)

The purpose of the other notebooks is to show a minimal example of a simple and relatable task.

## Contributing

Each candidate for a quantum 'Hello World' should be in the form of Jupyter notebook or python (.py) file . Your quantum program must be short and simple. A basic guide for what this means is:
* It should do one task that is easy for non-experts to understand;
* There should be no more than 10-15 lines of qiskit code between setting up the `QuantumRegister`, and calling `execute`.

Feel free to submit even if your project doesn't obey these rules. Even if it is not suitable for this folder, we may want to include it elsewhere in these tutorials.

For more on how to contribute, see the main [README](../../README.md) for these tutorials.
