    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Qiskit Chemistry to compute the ground state energy of molecular Hydrogen (H$_2$) using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) variational form.  This notebook uses the so called *declarative approach*: a Python dictionary automatically generated via the Qiskit Chemistry GUI wizard summarizes the entire experiment declaratively.  That dictionary is simply then passed as a paramter to the `run` method of the `QiskitChemistry` solver to get the result of the experiment, also in the form of a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users who are more interested in learning the Qiskit Aqua and Qiskit Chemistry APIs and/or in contributing new algorithmic components can look at the same experiment executed [programmatically](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/chemistry/programmatic_approach.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been written to use the HDF5 chemistry driver. This driver uses molecular data that has been serialized from a prior computation.  This allows this notebook to be executed with no additional driver installation requirements. See the Qiskit Chemistry driver documentation for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import `QiskitChemistry`, which is the object that will carry out the computation for us"

    "Next, we create a Python dictionary to specify the problem we want to solve. There are defaults for many additional values that are not shown here for simpicity. Indeed, we take advantage of using sensisble defaults that the Qiskit Chemistry stack provides.  As mentioned above, the Qiskit Chemistry GUI wizard allows for automatic extraction of the Python dictionary, reflecting the current configuration.  Once the Python dictionary has been extracted, it can be pasted into a Python program or a Jupyter Notebook and, if necessary, edited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first entry names a chemistry driver. This example uses HDF5 and the next line configures the driver for an `hdf5` file that contains data from a prior computation for an H$_2$ molecule with basis set `sto-3g`. The operator line would be automatically set by default, but we have added it here to show it and to emphasize where the problem input is converted into a quantum qubit form. We then indicate to the `QiskitChemistry` solver that the VQE algorithm should be used in this experiment, using the COBYLA optimizer with a UCCSD variatonal form and initial state of HartreeFock. VQE uses the variational method to find the mimimum eigenvalue of a problem, which in this case is the ground state energy of the molecule."
