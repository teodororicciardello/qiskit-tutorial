## Contributor License Agreement

We'd love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few legal
requirements sorted out. By having you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), we
ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

When you contribute to the Qiskit project with a new pull request, a bot will
evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on
the pull request,  including a link to accept the agreement. The
[individual CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf) document is
available for review as a PDF.

If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-corporate-cla.pdf)
and email it to us at qiskit@qiskit.org.
